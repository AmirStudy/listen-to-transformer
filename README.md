Listen to Transformer
====================
[Piano Transformer](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/piano-transformer) is an open source machine learning model from the [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/) research group at Google that can generate musical performances with some long-term structure. We find it interesting to see what these models can and can’t do, so we made this app to make it easier to explore and curate the model’s output.

You can read more about the model in the [blog post](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/music-transformer) announcing it, the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04281) it was published in, or the [blog post](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/listen-to-transformer) about this app.
