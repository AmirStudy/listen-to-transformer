Listen-to-transformer
====================
[Piano Transformer](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/piano-transformer) is an open source machine learning model from the [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/) research group at Google that can generate musical performances with some long-term structure. We find it interesting to see what these models can and can’t do, so we made this app to make it easier to explore and curate the model’s output.

If you listen to a bunch of samples, you’ll probably discover that these compositions (like a lot of fully AI-generated music) are nowhere near as good and interesting as what people compose. And that’s okay! We just thought it would be fun for more people to be able to hear them, think about them, or remix them in their own music.So here is a radio station of 10000 random, not cherry-picked, samples. They are all downloadable as MIDI files under a CC0 (“No Rights Reserved”) license, so if you want to take one of the pieces and make it your own, do it -- we’d love to hear all about it!

For those interested in all the ones and zeros of this work, you can read more about the model in the [blog post](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/music-transformer) announcing it, or the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04281) it was published in.
